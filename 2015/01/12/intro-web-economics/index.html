<h4 id="Prisoner_u2019s_Dilemma"><a href="#Prisoner_u2019s_Dilemma" class="headerlink" title="Prisoner’s Dilemma"></a>Prisoner’s Dilemma</h4><p>Two suspects are arrested for robbery, they are interrogated separately. The police tell them if one of them confesses, he will be released immediately, the other one gets 10 years penalty; if neither confesses, both get 1 year sentence; if both confess, they all get 4 years in prison. The payoff table can be derived from this example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Don’t confess</th>
<th>Confess</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Don’t confess</td>
<td>-1,-1</td>
<td>-10,0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Confess</td>
<td>0,-10</td>
<td>-4,-4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can derived from the table that confessing is a strictly dominant strategy. Even though not confessing is better for both of them, but under rational play this is not achieved.</p>
<p>This kind of dilemma arises frequently like performance-enhancing drugs for athletes. The payoffs must be aligned right.</p>

<p><em>S</em> is a best response to <em>T</em> if $P_1(S,T) \leq P_1(S’,T)$ for all other strategies S’ of player 1. S is strict best response when not equal.</p>

<p>In this situation, firm 1 (column player) has a dominant strategy “Low-priced”, whereas firm 2 does not. Firm 2 now can assume firm 1 will play this dominant strategy. Therefore, our prediction for this game is: .60,.40.</p>
<p>What if neither player has a dominant strategy? Expect players to use strategies that are best responses to one another.</p>
<h4 id="Nash_Equilibrium"><a href="#Nash_Equilibrium" class="headerlink" title="Nash Equilibrium"></a>Nash Equilibrium</h4><p>(S,T) is Nash Equilibrium if S is a best response to T, and T is a best response to S. In other words, at Nash Equilibrium, no player wants to unilaterally (done only by one player) deviate to an alternative strategy.</p>
<p>We can have multiple Nash equilibria (A,A) and (B,B)</p>

<h4 id="Mixed_Strategies"><a href="#Mixed_Strategies" class="headerlink" title="Mixed Strategies"></a>Mixed Strategies</h4><p>Instead of choosing strategies directly, define a probability you will choose a strategy. Player 1 commits to play H with some probability p, similarly, player 2 plays H with probability q. This is called a mixed strategy, as opposed to a pure strategy.</p>
<h3 id="Case_Study_3A_ISP_Competition"><a href="#Case_Study_3A_ISP_Competition" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: ISP Competition"></a>Case Study: ISP Competition</h3><p>How does the outcome of competition among two Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in a competitive market?</p>
<p>Assume we have n number of ISPs offer their service (Bandwidth) to the customers. The cost to ISP i of producing $q_i$ units of the Bandwidth is $C_i(q_i)$, where $C_i$ is an increasing function. The bandwidth is sold at a single price $P(Q)$, where Q is the total output and P is a decreasing function unless it is already zero. If the output of each ISP i is $q_i$, then the price is P(q_1+…+q_n), so revenue of i is $q_iP(q_1+…+q_n)$. Thus, ISP i’s profit, equal to its revenue minus its cost, is:<br>$F_i(q_i,…,q_n) = q_i P(q_1+…+q_n)-C_i(q_i)$</p>
<p>Terminologies for ISP games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players: the ISPs</li>
<li>Actions: the set of its possible outputs $q1$,…,$q_n$</li>
<li>Utilities: ISPs preferences are represented by their profits $F_1,…,F_n$</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Repeated_Games"><a href="#Repeated_Games" class="headerlink" title="Repeated Games"></a>Repeated Games</h3><p>In a repeated game, a simultaneous-move normal-form game is played over and again by the same players. For example, the players may play Prisoner’s Dilemma game for 10 time periods. The game that is repeated in each period is referred to as the stage game. The equilibria of a repeated game can differ from those of the associated stage game. There are many new strategies, players can condition their play on the history of play in previous rounds. Like, a player may be deterred from exploiting her short-term advantage by the “threat” of “punishment” that reduces her long-term payoff.</p>
<p>Suppose that two people are involved repeatedly in an interaction, the short-term incentives are captured by the Prisoner’s Dilemma, which payoffs as:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>C</th>
<th>D</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>2,2</td>
<td>0,3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>3,0</td>
<td>1,1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>where C as cooperation (don’t confess), and D as defection (confess).</p>
<p>For this model, there are two nash equilibras: grim trigger strategy and the strategy pair that each player choose D after every history. For grim trigger strategy, the outcome in which (C,C) occurs in every period is supported as a Nash equilibrium if the players are sufficiently patient. But, how patient do they have to be?</p>
<p>What other outcomes are supported?</p>
<h4 id="Grim_Trigger_Strategy"><a href="#Grim_Trigger_Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Grim Trigger Strategy"></a>Grim Trigger Strategy</h4><p>Grim triger Strategy for this repeated game is that choose C so long as the other player chooses C; if in any period the other player choose D, then choose D in every subsequent period as punishment.</p>
<p>If player 1 applies grim trigger strategy, player 2 is better off choosing C in every period, as long as the value she attaches to future payoffs is not too small compared with the current payoffs.</p>
<h4 id="Discounting"><a href="#Discounting" class="headerlink" title="Discounting"></a>Discounting</h4><p>In reality, for a repeated game, we cannot just define the utility as the sum over all periods as this would be unbounded in gerenal. The payoffs for future period should be discounted with a discount factor $\delta \in (0,1)$ due to the game mishgt stop in any round or future inflation. Each player assigns a higher weight to utility in the current stage than future stage. For instance, for player i:</p>
<ul>
<li>the utility obtained in stage 0 is $u^0_i$</li>
<li>the utility obtained in stage 1 is $\delta u^1_i$</li>
<li>the utility obtained in stage 2 is $\delta^2 u^2_i$</li>
</ul>
<p>For an infinitely repeated game, player i’s total utility for history action $h = (a^0, a^1,…)$ is</p>
<p>$u<em>i(h) = \sum \limits</em>{k=0}^2 \delta^k u_i(a^k)$</p>
<p>where $a^k$ is a set of actions for all players at stage k.</p>
<h4 id="Grim_Trigger_Strategy-1"><a href="#Grim_Trigger_Strategy-1" class="headerlink" title="Grim Trigger Strategy"></a>Grim Trigger Strategy</h4><p>Suppose player 1 and player 2 both adopt grim trigger strategy, the outcome is (C,C) in every stage and players obtain the stream of payoffs (2,2,…). The utility for both player are:</p>
<p>$u(h) = \sum \limits<em>{k=0}^\infty \delta^k u(a^k) = \sum \limits</em>{k=0}^\infty \delta^k 2 = 2/(1-\delta)$</p>
<p>If player 2 adopts a different strategy, there is at least one period, player 2’s choice triggers the punishment, so in all subsequent periods player 1 chooses D. This yields the stream of payoffs (2,…,3,1,…). Starting D earlier would have a better utility, now assume player 2 choose D in first stage, Now the new utility for player 2 is:</p>
<p>$u_2(h)’ = \sum \delta^k u(a^k) = 3 + \delta + \delta^2 +… = 2 + \frac{1}{1-\delta}=\frac{3-2\delta}{1-\delta}$</p>
<p>Let $u_2(h) \geq u_2(h)’$, we get $\delta \geq \frac{1}{2}$.</p>
<p>So, if $\delta \geq \frac{1}{2}$, grim trigger strategy is a Nash Equilibrium for Infinitely Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma.</p>
<h4 id="Limited_Punishment_Strategy"><a href="#Limited_Punishment_Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Limited Punishment Strategy"></a>Limited Punishment Strategy</h4><p>This strategy punishes deviations for only $k$ periods, then reverting to choose C, no matter how the other player hebaved during her punishment.</p>
<p>Suppose player 1 adopts this strategy, player 2 does not deviate during first k+1 period, the total utility is:</p>
<p>$u_2(h) = 2(1+\delta+\delta^2+…+\delta^k) = \frac{2(1-\delta^{k+1})}{1-\delta}$</p>
<p>If player 2 chooses D in the first period. Then player 1 will choose D in each of the next k periods, in response player 2 should also choose D in these periods. In the $k+1$st period after the deviation player 1 switches back to C. At this moment, player 2 faces precisely the same situation that he faced at the beginning of game. So if his deviation increases her payoff, it increase her payoff during the first k+1 peroids, the total utility is:</p>
<p>$u_2(h)’ = 3 + \delta + \delta^2 + … + \delta^k = 2 + \frac{1-\delta^{k+1}}{1-\delta}$</p>
<p>Thus, player 2 cannot increase her payoff by deviating if and only if $u_2(h) \geq u_2(h)’$ which leads to </p>
<p>$\delta^{k+1}-2\delta+1 \leq 0$.</p>
<ul>
<li>if k = 1, then no value of $\delta \in (0,1)$ satisfies the inequality. This means that one period of punishment is not severe enough to discourage a deviation, however patient the players are.</li>
<li>if k = 2, then the inequality is satisfied for $\delta \geq 0.62$</li>
<li>if k = 3, $\delta \geq 0.55$</li>
<li>as k increases the lower bound on $\delta$ approached to 0.5, the lower bound for the grim strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Tic-for-Tat_Strategy"><a href="#Tic-for-Tat_Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tic-for-Tat Strategy"></a>Tic-for-Tat Strategy</h4><p>In strategy tic-for-tat, the length of the punishment depends on the behavior of the player being punished. If the other player continues to choose D then tic-for-tat continues to do so; if the other player reverts to C then tic-for-tat reverts to C too.</p>
<p>Suppose player 1 adheres tic-for-tat strategy, and player 2 choose D at the first stage. Then player 1 will switch to D, then player 2 has two options: revert to C, in which case in the next periods she faces the same situation as she did at the start of the game, or continue to choose D, in which case player 1 will continue with D too.</p>
<p>If player 2 alternates between D and C then the stream of payoffs is 3,0,3,0,… with utility $u_2(h)’ = \frac{3}{(1-\delta)(1+\delta)}$.</p>
<p>If player 2 chooses 2 in every period, the stream of payoffs is 3,1,1,1,… with utility $u_2(h)’’ = \frac{3-2\delta}{1-\delta}$</p>
<p>Since the utility of player 2 adopting tic-for-tat is $u_2(h) = 2/(1-\delta)$, we can conclude that tic-for-tat is a best response to tit-for-tat if and only if </p>
<p>$u_2(h) \geq u_2(h)’$ and $u_2(h) \geq u_2(h)’’$ which leads to $\delta \geq 0.5$</p>
<p>The winning deterministic strategy was tic for tat in the Interated Prisoners’ Dilemma (IPD) tournament.</p>
<h3 id="Human_Computation_and_Crowdsourcing"><a href="#Human_Computation_and_Crowdsourcing" class="headerlink" title="Human Computation and Crowdsourcing"></a>Human Computation and Crowdsourcing</h3><p>Crowdsourcing greatly facilitates human computation (but they are not equivalent).</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity</li>
<li>Independence</li>
<li>Decentralization</li>
<li>Aggregation</li>
</ul>
<p>Inputs: large, diverse sample to increase the likelihood of overall pool quality. The output is some kind of consensus or selection (aggregation)</p>
<h4 id="ESP_Game"><a href="#ESP_Game" class="headerlink" title="ESP Game"></a>ESP Game</h4><p>Lots of crowdsourcing is completed via gamification, that is, create games that enable human computation to gather required data. One popular example is The ESP Game: A two player online game, partners don’t know each other and can’t communicate. The object of the game: type the same word. The only thing in common is an image.</p>

<p>The challenge is that the error rate in confusion matrix is not enough to check if a worker is a spammer or not ()If the dataset is unbalanced). We should use more dataset.</p>
<p>Flase Negative</p>
<p>Challenge 1: spammer are lazy and smart</p>
<p>Challenge 2: user are biased.</p>
<p>Solution: reverse the error biased worker made, and then compute the error rate.</p>

<p>If $y = 0$, $Cost(h<em>\theta (x),y) = -log(1 - h</em>\theta (x))$</p>
<p>Simplified Cost Function:<br>$Cost(y_hat,y) = -ylog(y_hat) - (1-y)log(1-y_hat)$</p>

<p>What is clustering?</p>
<p>A grouping of data objects such that objects within a group are similar/related to one another and different from/unrelated to the objects in other groups. Make sure that intra-cluster distances are minimzed and inter-cluster distances are maximized.</p>
<p>Outliers are objects that do not belong to any cluster or form clusters of very small cardinality. In some applications we are interested in discovering outliers, not clusters like outliers analysis.</p>
